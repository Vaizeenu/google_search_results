## Things I won't / can't do:
    - Can't add the "fade out" transparency on the "images" section. Tried some combination of ::before, but it doesn't work, at least not without spending way too much time on this, so I moved on and hopefully will be able to learn that trick at some point. PS using only CSS. For future reference, possible solution here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12779776/linear-fade-out-div-content-and-border-solid-at-top-to-transparent-at-bottom
