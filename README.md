# google_search_results
a recreation of the google search results page, for educational purposes

## Things:
    - Can't add the "fade out" transparency on the "images" section. Tried some combination of ::before, but it doesn't work, at least not without spending way too much time on this, so I moved on and hopefully will be able to learn that trick at some point. P.S. using only CSS. For future reference, possible solution here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12779776/linear-fade-out-div-content-and-border-solid-at-top-to-transparent-at-bottom.
    - Didn't change the color in the results part after the right arrow thingy. It is a lighter grey. At this point in recreating the webpage, i'd rather finish the webpage than lose time on this minor detail. example: I won't change the 
    "www.website.com ->  ***This Part of the link***"
    - Haven't changed the color and won't make the minor adjustment in the position of the downward arrow in  roughly the same spot as the above part. 
    - Won't make the bubble in "images for build this webpage" into a link. I know how to do it and at this point it's just a time sink, since I'd rather finish the project sooner and move on to the next webpage project.
    - CSS is pretty much all over the place; halfway through i decided to use some typical class "archetypes" since I was using them quite often (such as display: flex and either row or column configuration into a single class), but it's going to take me some time to streamline the whole code, which at this point, is (methinks) beyond the scope of the educational purpose of the exercise. I'd like to move on to the next project and use what I have learned over there.
